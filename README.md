Go with brute force/complete search first!  
Use more memory to become faster!

### Bit Manipulation

- pascal_triangle_walk(CJ20/1A/EASY): Walk through pascal triangle to achieve a sum  **Quadratic numbers/decomposing number**

### Complete Search
- pylons(CJ19/1A): Place pylons in a grid so the adjacent numeration is not in same row, column or diagonal **Backtracing/Random**  

### Dynamic Programming

### Game Theory
- you_can_go_your_own_way(CJ19/Q/EASY): Traverse through grid from top left to bottom right by doing the **Opposite strategy**

### Greedy

- parenting_partnering_returns(CJ20/Q/EASY): Come up with scheduler that kid is always observed by sorting intervals and then assigning **Scheduling**  

### Grid
- expogo(CJ20/1B/MEDIUM): Jump in (i-1)^2 steps to see if you can reach a goal **Odd/Even**  
- square_dance(CJ20/1A/HARD): each dancer in the grid battles against compass neighbors **Linked list**  
- vestigium(CJ20/Q/EASY): Compute trace and number of rows and columns with duplicated entries in Latin square matrix (each row and cell have values from 1,...,N) **Set**

### Interactive

- blindfolded_bullseye(CJ20/1B/MEDIUM): Try to hit center of a bulls eye by finding its edges through **Binary search**
- esab_atad(CJ20/Q/MIDDLE): 25% of complementing, reversing bits **Bit manipulation**
- golf_gophers(CJ19/1A/MIDDLE): Ask how much flags of a windmill have changed by querying prime numbers **Probability/Chinese remainder/Prime**  

### Numbers
- foregone_solution(CJ19/Q/EASY): Split number into a sum so that no 4 occurs **Digit Traversing**
- cryptopangrams(C19/Q/MIDDLE): Pangram is a phrase where each letter is there at least one time. Decode prime numbers that are assigned to each letter **Prime/GCD**

### Recursion


### Sorting


### String

- nesting_depth(CJ20/Q/EASY): Create string so that the integers have a closing pair of parenthesis around them **Parenthesis**
- pattern_matching(CJ20/1A_HARD): Find string that exists in patterns including asterisks by suffix and prefix **Prefix/Suffix**


### Tree


### Trie
- alien_rhyme(CJ19/1A/HARD): Create suffix try to find longest suffix pairs **Prefix/Suffix**


### Others
- fair_fight(CJ19/1B): Find pairs of fights so that the maximum difference is smaller than K **Linear/Binary Search** 
### Sorting
- triplet_bubble_sort(CJ/Q): Determine the first index where triplet bubble sort fails by swapping left and right elements when it is always comparing **EVEN & ODD** elements  
- evacuation_plan(CJ18/PR): Release max. two senators at a time so there is no absolute majority in the room left  **ASCII**  
- parenting(CJ20/Q): Come up with scheduler that kid is always observed by sorting intervals and then assigning **Intervals**  
- rock_paper_scissors_tournament(CJ19/1C): Find R/P/S to beat everybody with the same strategy in the tournament **LOGIC**  
- swap_shield_to_minimize_damage(CJ18/Q): Find the minimum amount of hacks that needs to be done to protect the shield against charging and shooting commands of aliens **MINIMIZE/LOGIC** 
- scrabble_new_word_SA.cpp(CJ18/1C): Tiles of letters are forming words and a new unique word has to be found **Back Propagation/Complete Search**
- traverse_diagonal_newly(CJ19/1B): Find crepe cart in manhattan by **Manhattan Distance**
- traverse_diagonal_newly(CJ19/1B): find another way to traverse a grid from NW to SE  
- ant_stack(CJ18/1C): Maximum number of ants that form a stack so the lower one is larger and can carry the weight of the upper ones **HARD**  
- diameter_of_binary_tree(LC): Recursively traverse binary tree to find longest path between two nodes
- guessing_number(CJ18/PR): **Binary search** of guessing the number
- lollipop_shop(C18/1C): Sell least popular lollipop by tracking count of lollipops already sold **Probabilistic**
- poblation_rings(C19/1B): Ring poblate after x days. Ask at which day to infer how many have been there of the 6 rings on Day 1 **Modulo**
- power_arrangers(C19/1C): Ask max. 150 times for a permutation out of 5 puppets to find that one missing out of 120. 119/23/5/1 **Logic**


## Common Mistakes

- check data types of inputs to avoid overflow like(long long instead of int)  
- float cast creates troubles  
- out of bounce check missing  
- alphabet helps with constant memory [26]  
- read line in python incorrectly
- swap to do fast memory changes  
- sort changed order that is important for result
