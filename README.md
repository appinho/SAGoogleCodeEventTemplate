## Areas 

* Bit
- pascal_triangle_walk(CJ20/1A): Walk through pascal triangle to achieve a sum  

* Grid
- latin_squares/vestigium(CJ20/QR): compute trace and number of rows and columns with dublicated entries in latin square matrix (each row and cell have values from 1,...,N)  
- square_dance_elimination(CJ20/1A): each dancer in the grid battles against compass neighbors  

* Interactive

- esab(CJ20/QR): 25% Bit manipulation of complementing, reversing

* Interval

- parenting(CJ20/QR): Come up with scheduler that kid is always observed by sorting intervals and then assigning

* String

- pattern_matching(CJ20/1A): Find string that exists in patterns including asterisks by suffix and prefix
- surround_int_by_parentheses/nesting_depth(CJ20/QR): Create string so that the integers have a closing pair of parentheses around them

## Common Mistakes

- check data types of inputs to avoid overflow like(long long instead of int)  
- float cast creates troubles  
- out of bounce check missing  
- read line in python incorrectly
- swap to do fast memory changes  
- sort changed order that is important for result
