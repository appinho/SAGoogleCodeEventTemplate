## Common Mistakes

- check data types of inputs to avoid overflow like(long long instead of int)  
- float cast creates troubles  
- out of bounce check missing  
- alphabet helps with constant memory [26]  
- read line in python incorrectly
- swap to do fast memory changes  
- sort changed order that is important for result
