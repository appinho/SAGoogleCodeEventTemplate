Go with brute force/complete search first!  
Use more memory to become faster!  

## Areas 

### Bit
- pascal_triangle_walk(CJ20/1A): Walk through pascal triangle to achieve a sum  **Quadratic numbers/decomposing number**

## Dynamic Programming
- ant_stack(CJ18/1C): Maximum number of ants that form a stack so the lower one is larger and can carry the weight of the upper ones **HARD**  

### Grid
- latin_squares/vestigium(CJ20/QR): compute trace and number of rows and columns with dublicated entries in latin square matrix (each row and cell have values from 1,...,N)  
- square_dance_elimination(CJ20/1A): each dancer in the grid battles against compass neighbors **Memory**  

### Interactive

- esab(CJ20/QR): 25% **Bit manipulation** of complementing, reversing
- guessing_number(CJ18/PR): **Binary search** of guessing the number
- lollipop_shop(C18/1C): Sell least popular lollipop by tracking count of lollipops already sold **Probabilistic**
### Recursion

- scrabble_new_word_SA.cpp(CJ18/1C): Tiles of letters are forming words and a new unique word has to be found **Back Propagation/Complete Search**

### Sorting

- triplet_bubble_sort(CJ/QR): Determine the first index where triplet bubble sort fails by swapping left and right elements when it is always comparing **EVEN & ODD** elements  

### Strategic

- evacuation_plan(CJ18/PR): Release max. two senators at a time so there is no absolute majority in the room left  **ASCII**  
- parenting(CJ20/QR): Come up with scheduler that kid is always observed by sorting intervals and then assigning **Intervals**
- swap_shield_to_minimize_damage(CJ18/QR): Find the minimum amount of hacks that needs to be done to protect the shield against charging and shooting commands of aliens **MINIMIZE/LOGIC** 

### String

- pattern_matching(CJ20/1A): Find string that exists in patterns including asterisks by suffix and prefix
- surround_int_by_parentheses/nesting_depth(CJ20/QR): Create string so that the integers have a closing pair of parentheses around them

## Common Mistakes

- check data types of inputs to avoid overflow like(long long instead of int)  
- float cast creates troubles  
- out of bounce check missing  
- alphabet helps with constant memory [26]  
- read line in python incorrectly
- swap to do fast memory changes  
- sort changed order that is important for result
